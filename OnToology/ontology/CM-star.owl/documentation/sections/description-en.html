  Figure shows how this vocabulary extends the Conceptual Mapping to allow the generation of RDF-star graphs. `StatementMap` can be quoted using the properties `hasQuotedSubject` and `hasQuotedObject` for the positions of subject and object respectively. The quoted statement maps can in turn contain more quoted Statement Maps inside. A quoted Statement Map is asserted by default. It can be non asserted indicating when the Statement Map is a `NonAssertedStatementMap`.
